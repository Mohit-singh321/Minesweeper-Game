# Minesweeper-Game

#Minesweeper is a classic single-player puzzle game where the goal is to clear a grid without triggering any hidden mines. The game consists of a board divided into cells. Some of these cells contain mines, while others are empty.

When a player clicks on a cell:

#    If it's a mine, the game ends (you lose).

#    If it's not a mine, the cell reveals a number indicating how many mines are adjacent to it (including diagonals).

#    If the number is 0, the game automatically reveals neighboring cells, continuing recursively.

The player uses logic and deduction to figure out the location of the mines and mark them with flags. The game is won when all non-mine cells are revealed and all mines are correctly flagged.
